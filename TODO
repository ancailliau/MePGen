- Clean the project (README, etc.)
- Find a way to produce, from a given automaton, a new automaton that only accepts words of a certain minimum size
- Implement text_to_automaton (only some calls to sub-algorithms)
- Add more flexibility on choosing retained characters in text_to_matrix by giving a filter function instead of a set of characters
